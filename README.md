# position-data-generator

This Generator uses actor pattern

to generate UE location trajectories (for 3gpp, 5G projects)

with certain variations from day to day

That is (for example) useful to generate

fake AMF-like data and try to employ ML algorithm

on this data , predicting UE location.


To configure see application conf..

To run  - run the Main object
