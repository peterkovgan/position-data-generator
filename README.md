Tags: UE, 3GPP, UE Mobility, UE trajectories, NWDAF

This Generator generates UE location trajectories 

(To emulate UE data for 3gpp, 5G projects)

Data includes certain UE behaviour variations (time/space) from day to day.

Variations could be controlled and changed.

That is (for example) useful to generate

fake AMF-UE-Location data in order to train/test ML algorithms, responsible for UE location prediction. 


To configure: see application conf..

To run: run the Main object


Example Trajectories:
